# 🗒️ Development Notes  

A personal log of ideas, learnings, and reminders while working on *The Shift: Prologue*.  

---

## 📚 Learning Notes  
- [ ] Basics of Unity/Unreal engine setup  
- [ ] Rendering pipeline concepts (forward vs deferred)  
- [ ] Animation workflows for 3D characters  
- [ ] Shader experiments to create eerie post-Shift atmosphere  

---

## 💡 Game Ideas  
- Alien parasite enemies that evolve over encounters  
- Faction-based survival: worshippers of new gods vs scientists experimenting on survivors  
- Madness system: prolonged exposure to eldritch areas causes visual/auditory distortion  

---

## 🎨 Concept Art Reminders  
- Focus first on Arin Sharma (main character) outfit + silhouette  
- Environment references: collapsed cities twisted by alien growths  
- Monsters: mix of **flesh + tech + parasite**  

---

## 🛠️ To-Do (Short Term)  
- [ ] Gather references for concept art  
- [ ] Sketch basic character silhouettes  
- [ ] Experiment with CapCut video editing workflow for devlogs  
- [ ] Try exporting a simple 3D model into the engine  

---

## 🧠 Random Thoughts  
- The Shift’s constellations should feel alien but faintly familiar → unsettling skybox design  
- Maybe add **voice logs** as hidden lore collectibles  
- Resource scarcity should tie directly into survival horror tension (low food, low light, high paranoia)
