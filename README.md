# 🌌 The Shift: Prologue  
**A Post-Apocalyptic Cosmic Horror RPG (In Development)**

---

## 📖 Synopsis  
Arin Sharma was just a cyber expert, until the world ended.  

On **May 14, 2032**, Earth didn’t burn—it vanished.  
A rift tore open the sky, and the planet was hurled into a distant, hostile galaxy. Cities collapsed, billions disappeared, and humanity was thrown into an extinction event without fire or warning. Survivors call it **The Shift**.  

Now, Earth lingers in alien space, twisted and unrecognizable. Governments have fallen, technology decays, and the stars themselves are foreign. Something watches from the void—ancient, silent, and cold.  

In this world of horror and survival, Arin discovers a buried truth: The Shift wasn’t random. It was a warning. And something has responded.  

This RPG blends **survival, body horror, and cosmic dread** in a world where:  
- **Mutations roam the wastelands** – fusions of flesh, parasite, and rogue tech.  
- **Humanity has splintered** – factions worship alien gods, conduct experiments, and wage wars for dominance.  
- **The true invaders awaken** – eldritch beings whose presence twists reality itself.  

The question isn’t just how to survive…  
It’s whether humanity deserves to.
