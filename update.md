# 📝 Development Update Log  

## 📅 Current Status – September 2025  
Currently in the **early learning phase** of development.  
Most of my time is spent **watching tutorials and studying basics** in:  
- Game engines (Unreal/Unity fundamentals)  
- 3D modeling & asset creation workflows  
- Rendering pipelines & optimization concepts  
- Narrative integration & lore building  

🎥 Sharing the journey: I’m recording my learning process with short devlog-style videos.

### 🔹 Phase 2 – Prototyping (3–6 months)  
- Create the **first playable demo**  
- Test core mechanics (movement, combat, survival features)  
- Add placeholder assets for playtesting  

### 🔹 Phase 3 – Vertical Slice (6–12 months)
